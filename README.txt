John Young
Good morning everybody and welcome to this public meeting to discuss the Bridge Road Cycleway. I acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the traditional owners of this land and I pay my respect to elders both past and present and I pay my respect to any Aboriginal persons in the room with us today and any who are to arrive, and I know one at least who is on her way here. This always was and always will be Aboriginal land. My name is John Young. I'm a resident of Bridge Road. I'm a very proud member of the Glebe Society. And for what it is worth, I'm a barrister. I want to thank the Glebe Society and its president, Duncan Lees, and also Janet Oakley, who is the convener of the Transport and Traffic Committee, for helping to organise today's event. I do want to also acknowledge today the presence of our local member, Kobi Shetty. We really do appreciate you being here today, Kobi. Having been involved with members of parliament myself, I know they get very little free time and Sunday mornings are one of those few times that they have for family, so it's great for you to be here. Thank you, Kobi. If you're not a member of the Glebe Society, can I invite you to join it? It's a wonderful society in terms of both connection people in Glebe and about finding out about the history of this place called Glebe or as Gough Whitlam would always call it, "The Glebe". Today I have also some apologies. We start with no less than the Lord Mayor herself, the Right Honourable Clover Moore, who was invited but was unable to attend because of a previous commitment. Dr. Marjorie O'Neill, who is the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport, which is basically the Assistant Minister who transport sends an apology, and Peter McLean, or McLean, CEO of Bicycle New South Wales, also sends an apology. Also, I want to say that there's a chair over there, which is for the Minister, Mr. Graham, John Graham, who was invited to attend to hear the safety issues in relation to the Bridge Road Cycleway. Sadly, we didn't get an apology, but we do know that from what he has sent to Kobe, that he's not going to be attending. And that as far as he's concerned, there are no issues involved. Have to say that at the last state election, Labor made commitments for consultation in relation to the bridge road cycleway. I assume those commitments were genuinely meant and didn't only apply if Labor won the seat, which they didn't, Kobe won the seat quite easily, but the fact is Labour made commitments in relation to this area. And this is an important part of Sydney and Labour has not kept those commitments. The previous minister, Jo Haylen, just consistently refused to come and we're hoping that there might be a change when John Graham became the Minister, but sadly that does not seem to have been the case. Now today we're going to be hearing from the renowned and dare I say a legendary safety expert, road safety expert Zoran Bakovic of Traffic Engineering Centre. But first I would like to invite Di Anstey to speak. Di is a long-term Bridge Road resident and the founder of the Bridge Road Friends. For the past five years since, as you probably all recall, we got a temporary cycleway along Bridge Road during COVID, Di has been the leader and the inspiration in the cause of fighting for safety along Bridge Road and what is quite frankly a disgusting site in relation to that cycleway, the way it's been kept for the last five years. During the time that the Liberals were in government, Di was able to get them to come out and look at the cycleway because apart from Ben Fordham himself, the most regular guest on the Ben Fordham, or most regular person appearing was Di Anstey. And it works with the Liberals, it doesn't seem to work with Labor. But that led to both Ministers Constance, remember him, and Rob Stokes coming out and looking at the cycleway and Di will tell you what each of them had to say. But I want to thank you all for coming here today on what is an absolutely beautiful Sunday morning. It's what makes Sydney such a great city that days like today in the Sydney winter. But I do want to now hand over to Di Anstey to tell you a little bit about the fight over the last five years in relation to this cycleway. Thank you.

Di Anstey
(APPLAUSE) Morning, everybody. Thank you all for coming. What I'm going to try and do is condense five years of history into five minutes. So please bear with me. It's wonderful to see the community come together at this historic venue. Can you please raise your hands if you live locally?

Di Anstey
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT) Can you... Can I also ask if there are any staff from Transport NSW or City of Sydney here?

Di Anstey
(audience murmurs) (mic issue) Now, is that better?

Di Anstey
Yes. - Okay.
Can I also ask if there are any staff from Transport New South Wales or City of Sydney here today? What a surprise. Not a soul. Neither organisation has been interested in consultation and listening to the community views on either the pop-up cycleway or the proposal to construct a permanent cycleway, which has been going on for five years. I'm very glad you're all here for Zoran's presentation. During the five years since the pop-up cycleway has been installed, I've written more letters than I can remember to the four ministers for transport who have been in office during that time. I have asked what is being done to fix the safety issues, requested meetings with ministers, and asked for more community consultation and complained that Transport for New South Wales are not being entirely honest with the community about the cycleway project. I've also written multiple times to Lord Mayor Clover Moore. The Lord Mayor replied to my letter in 2020 saying the pop-up cycleway would only stay for six months. Over the past five years, there have been many applications for documents the cycleway to be released to Bridge Road residents under Freedom of Information, GIPA. Thousands of emails and letters have passed between Transport for New South Wales and City of Sydney about the Bridge Road cycleway. So many documents, but still a safe cycleway design has not been achieved. That is what we discovered when we approached road safety expert Zoran Bakovic to conduct a a design stage road safety audit on the design for the permanent cycleway. The design was never released publicly for discussion and comment, as it should have been. Instead, we had to request the design be released under GIPA. Soon after it was announced the cycleway would be made permanent in March 2022, an options paper was provided under GIPA. One not to make the cycleway permanent. That was option number one. Next to that option was a comment, "Would cause reputational damage." I assume that damage was to Transport NSW. A few months later in October 2022, senior transport officials met with a neighbour and me on Bridge Road and told us construction on the cycleway would start in a few weeks. Twelve months later, documents provided under GIPA showed that a safe cycleway design had still not been achieved at the time of that meeting and no funding had been allocated to build the cycleway. Don't blame me for finding it hard to believe anything that is communicated from Transport NSW. This is interesting for Glee Point residents. plans to shorten the two right-hand turn lanes at Glebe Point Road and Ross Streets if the permanent cycleway is built. These locations are widely known to be dangerous for cyclists, yet these changes are not included in the cycleway design. If these changes are not in the cycleway design, they do not have to be audited for safety risks. If the two right-hand turns are shortened, traffic flow on Bridge Road will be disrupted and lengthy delays will occur. I was able to meet with two previous ministers for transport on Bridge Road, as John mentioned previously. Andrew Constance told me in 2021 that Bridge Road is the wrong location for a cycleway because it is a main arterial road. In 2022, Rob Stokes met with me and said Bridge Road was a mess. He instigated a review which went nowhere. Two days before the state election, in March 2023, during the caretaker period, Transport for New South Wales advertised a tender to build the cycleway. A few weeks later, a road safety audit was conducted on an incomplete cycleway design by the same company engaged to design the cycleway. The tender to construct was later abandoned without explanation. Last week in a letter to Kobi Shetty, the Minister for Transport claims a road safety audit conducted in 2023 on the incomplete cycleway design that was not by any stretch independent is a satisfactory safety review process to justify construction of the cycleway. I disagree with the Minister. The Glebe community deserves better than this. That is why Bridge Road Friends engaged Zoran BakoviÄ‡ to conduct a thorough safety audit on the cycleway design. I'm grateful to Zoran for joining us today to discuss the findings of his report. Both Jo Haylen and Minister for Transport following the 2023 election, and the current Minister John Graham, have ignored requests to meet with the community to discuss the cycleway issues. Finally, this meeting can be a catalyst for changing the Minister's mind. This cycleway is not being built at the moment as the Minister for Transport claims. It is a three-stage project which is two months behind schedule. Before the cycleway can be constructed, retrenching of the entire length of Bridge Road must be completed and then the entire length of Bridge Road must be resurfaced. After five years of investigation and safety reviews, in my view it is now crystal clear that it's not possible to build a safe cycleway on Bridge Road. The no-show by the Minister and transport officials today all but confirms that. Again, thank you for coming. (applause)

John Young
All right, thank you. Can you hear me without the mic? All right. Better with the mic, all right. All right.
Now, our speaker today is Zoran Bakovic. Zoran is one of the most, if not the most, sought after traffic experts in Australia. And as a lawyer, I know that experts in Australia in US films and television programs like, for example, The Verdict and the great Paul Newman film and others, and also with the tobacco industry, where people were just, experts were just basically guns for hire. In Australia, the rules are that experts must be independent, they must provide independent, genuinely held opinions and they've got to disclose any matters that would conflict with that. I do know that members of my profession queue up to obtain Zoran's opinions in court cases and his opinion is often the decisive factor in deciding cases, and Zoran's been involved in criminal matters and in civil cases where his evidence has been critical in determining an issue. I rather hope that Zoran's opinion might be critical in determining this issue, but we'll see about that. Zoran has also conducted hundreds of road safety audits. He is a master of engineering and he's also conducted road safety audits, I believe, for councils such as the City of Sydney, Parramatta, Ryde and Central Coast. And if you look at, I'm not sure if it's LinkedIn or his website, you'll see that Zoran has glowing references from Transport for New South Wales. And Zoran's approach, I think, he'll correct me if I'm wrong, but it's to understand both the aspects of traffic psychology, that is the human element in it, and also assessing the safety of the design and construction in relation to the safety of a road or cycleway. So when Bridge Road Friends commissioned Zoran to produce a report on the Bridge Road cycleway, we knew of his independence and we knew that he would simply give his honest opinion in relation to those matters. My view, those findings are utterly startling, but I won't steal Zoran's thunder about those findings. The person to discuss his findings and observations is Zoran, so I hand it over to you, Zoran.

Thank you, Will. [Applause]

[ Applause ]

Zoran Bakovic
Thank you very much John for a very nice wording. I usually feel more comfortable facing nasty barristers and crown prosecutors than somebody who flatters me. Thank you very much to all of you for coming today and dedicating your time on Sunday morning to attend this meeting and to hear this presentation. Before I start with the findings of the road safety audit, I'd like just to tell you that my role as a road safety auditor is not to advocate anything, nor to convince you in anything or anyone. Our job as a road safety auditor is to be independent and to present findings to whoever would like to hear that and to consider that. My approach, at least, and my company's approach, I apply that from the courtrooms, when as As an expert, I always follow the following four rules. This is evidence, analysis of evidence, reasoning and conclusions. And wherever that conclusion may lead us to. So before I start about that, I would like just for you, because I believe that most of you don't know what is road safety audit all about, and grasping a few concepts of that in the next five minutes would actually help you to comprehend and to understand the magnitude of the findings and especially the magnitude and whatever else about the response. So as I said, my link, whether you're a cyclist, motorist or community member, the subject matter of this meeting may be of particular relevance and interest, given its potential implication to local traffic conditions and public safety. And this actually would be about the tile design, road safety audit of the proposed permanent cycleway on the bridge road. So what is, don't worry, you don't need to read all this, I will just mention to you, what is road safety audit all about? As this is from the latest Outser Roads guidelines, because Transport for New South Wales in their response mentioned also a few times. And just road safety audit is a formal examination of future road or traffic project or existing road. And when qualified team just consider crash potential. So that's a proactive process. And what is very, very important is considering all road users. So if you actually, if you construct, you know, just if you design a pedestrian footpath or if you design pedestrian crossing or cycling way or road, you always need to consider all road users. So when you design for the cyclist, for the benefit of cyclists, you need to consider all road users. I will explain later on, you will see that. So what is road safety audit? It is a formal process and not an informal check. carried out by people who are independent of the design of the road authority, and carried out by people with appropriate experience and training and restricted road safety issues. What is the tricky part with the road safety audit? You may, I know that from the courtrooms when they actually ask on the court subpoena, road safety audit is a formal document and a very tricky document if something actually happened not just on the road, very tricky document, I'm sarcastic, for the road owner. Why? It would be used as evidence that the road owner had pre-knowledge of the deficiency that may actually cause the collision. And then I'm not Barrister, not I would like to pretend, but John and people like John could explain you what is that implications. And if you have couple of road safety audits, regardless of that road safety audit is road safety audit, they need to consider all of them. from the moment when that audit is submitted officially to the road owner. In this case, it's a transfer from New South Wales or city of Sydney regardless. So, road safety audit is more than checking compliance with the standards. Yes, standards are important because that's a minimum requirement, but road safety audit is more than checking standards. Standards is just checking fitness for the purpose. Whether or not something that is proposed is actually good fitness for the purpose from traffic safety point of view. Because standards are often minimum requirements and this is very important for this particular, combining a series of minimums is undesirable and could leave no room for error. This is from Austral Roads. Either on the part of the designer, the builder, or important, the final road users. And they also said, you know, just, that actually, you know, just everyone, we need to consider all road users, of course. Why audit the design? Among all to check that all likely road users have been considered, to check the signage, line markings. Can vehicles turn safely? Can road users see each other? Very important for this. So could you turn safely? Could you see each other? Please remember that. Is alignment and cross-section appropriate? are fixed hazard present, etc. etc. So to identify safety risks and hazards, again, AUSA-ROADS, the most recent one, including those not identified, whatever, and to ensure that design considers all foreseeable road users. That's a very important thing. All road users. Road safety audit is a process, it's not just a report. So we get design, we consider desktop analysis, site inspection, site inspection is important to see potential for implementation of the design, day and night especially in these urban areas. Then actually submitting road safety audit to whoever just ordered that and then designers are obligated to respond. They don't need to accept but they must explain the reasons for not accepting and the grounds. When we're doing risk matrix, this is risk matrix, when we're actually doing assessment of the risk level, risk level is not just a combination of likelihood, something to happen in severity. I will explain to you how that works. The first thing in this story is a deficiency. Then you ask yourself whether or not that deficiency could lead to driver's mistake or road users mistake and could lead to incident. If the actual answer is no, then you just report as deficiency to note. If answer is yes, then the next question is how likely that deficiency is to lead to an incident. And in the incident, just end up in collision, what is the likely severity of the collision? And then you actually have here a few examples. And then you find out is it medium or high or whatever. What we try to prevent with the road safety audits? We try to prevent this and this. Graphic, isn't it? However, the good news is these are staged photos. These are not collision photos because these photos are staged, you know, just for -- and I took them from the website of the legal firms that actually practice in the traffic law. I didn't want even to consider to show you the real photos. When you see the brain on the road, when you see actually everything else. And this is what actually road safety, because when -- and I present at technical conferences on AATP and Australian Traffic Management, that I was even president, New South Wales and ACT and IPWA and whatever on different places. And I said, we're talking about collision. It's a fatal collision, serious collision, whatever collision, and you get the impression that those collisions actually die. You know, that somebody else is killed. This is it. And I said, this is just actors. So road safety audit is a great tool. You must ask me why I actually show 16 Chapels. It's a very -- I mean, road safety audit is a great tool, but how we use available tools is what really matters. So Michelangelo, I guarantee you that I could go in the first art shop and buy better tool and better paints that Michelangelo had when he actually painted this ceiling. But I will never paint a ceiling like Michelangelo. And therefore, you have road safety audit tool, you know, just as a grade, and then you have road safety auditors, road safety auditors, road safety auditors. You know what I mean. Now, this is very important. I would like to show you, that's very important for this meeting, I would like to show you example of proper response to issue rights by road safety audit. This is one council, City of Paramarta, great council in that regards. And for example, look at this comments, pedestrian crossing left and pedestrian crossing right signs are missing to alert drivers, etc, etc, etc. What they said, it is proposed, so directly to that issue, it is proposed to install pedestrian crossing left, signs in that street, they show that, and then actually pedestrian cross right signs, not required, that's their opinion, as vehicles travelling on that road, approaching the other road from south, have a clear vision of pedestrian crossing, etc, etc, etc. So we find out that their response is valid, good, and that would actually result in a reasonably safe road environment, and therefore we close on that particular date, I want to stress the fact that there is no safe road environment. There is no safe facility. If you invented something like that, you would be a billionaire, a Nobel Prize winner. The maximum we could hope for is a reasonably safe road environment for reasonable users and just law-obeying people. Now we come to issue number one. So I believe you grasp at least what is road safety audit all about a little bit. This is designed from Transport for New South Wales. What we actually find out that the proposed effective width of the cycle lane is less than 1.5 meters. Why effective width? they actually point at 1.5 meters from the edge of the right curb separator to the end of the gutter. Gutter is not part of the cycleway. And also, you know, just every cyclist need to keep the distance from the right curb separator in order to avoid hitting or striking that with the pedal, which could lead in failing down either to the left or, most critically, to the right and in front of the bus or truck driver, deadly. This is from the manuals. So even manuals consider 0.2 meters. Now if you see, you know, 1.5 minus 0.5 minus 0.2, you get 0.8 meters of effective width. Where is 1.5 meters? Where is even minimum 1.2 meters? And the fundamental road section design principle is avoiding multiple minimum widths. And as Austral Road said themselves, the series of minimums would lead to the problems. Why? If you have minimum widths of the cycleway or less than minimum in this case, then you have minimum width of the traffic lane. mistake by 20, 30 centimeters, guess what? You're going to be hit by a car and then you have trucks and there is no clearance between the trucks, you know, just side mirrors could actually struck a cyclist. So this is not good for the cyclist that could kill cyclists. The very cyclist that actually where somebody, you know, just from, I don't know, Transport when you said wealth, wanted to help with by creating this cycle of facility. What they actually response. So we know now, you saw great example from Paramatha Council, you're missing this sign, they said okay we'll put this sign or we'll not put this sign, whatever. Now we actually showed evidence. the evidence, like here, I'm sorry. Okay, so just a sec please. Okay, this is this way. We show the evidence why we actually claim what we claim. And then, it is like this. Bridge roads is constrained corridor for transport, and transport has considered all road users in design of the cycleway. what that has to do with the findings, nothing. The design of the cycleway width is consistent with current standards and guidelines, including the outside roads, which is not true definitely, I showed the evidence, and takes careful account of relevant constraints. The bridge road cycleway upgrade will deliver 3 metres to 3.5 metres traffic lanes that reduce to a minimum 2.8 metres at locations such as Glebe Point Road, in addition to 1.5 Why cycleway in each direction? Where is that? And how is that related to this? So that's just some generalistic. Existing pedestrian crossings. Who mentioned pedestrian crossings? I mean this is unbelievable. Crossing widths, including the pedestrian refuge near cross street will be increased to 2.3 meters. Sorry, 3.6 meters. And then actually, you know, just, And then bridge road cycleway will also trial reduced land right turn base in Glibro. How that has anything to do with the issue of rights? I must tell you, I actually was involved in more than 950 road safety audits. Several hundreds of them, to transfer from New South Wales directly or infrastructure projects led by transfer from New South Wales. M4 and 5 tunneling, I was excluded, three billion dollar project. Newcastle bypass, Jerry Berry Bypass, Albion Park Rail, Norwich, North Road, you name it. Never in my career, I received something like this. You may agree or disagree, but this is absolutely like, you build a house, builder build a house, you have leak in your house, and then you complain about the leak in the bathroom, and the builder start, we are building great houses for our community, and your house is not different than other houses. And your front door is fantastic. And look at the garden, how appealing it is. What about the leaking?

Zoran Bakovic
[LAUGHTER] Issue number two, the same thing. Put here, 1.2 meters. And then actually protruding into the gutter. But they stop here, so we put actually those dot lines for you to see. So 1.2 meters here, and protruding gutter is less than a meter. Again, and this is actually traffic here. Again the same thing, I don't want you to just do. And then the design of bridge road cycleway has maximized the width of the cycle where possible. It's on you to conclude. The design of the cycle width is consistent with the current standards. We find out that it's not. And guidelines including our street roads, and we show that, and take careful account or relevant constraints. Nothing but. Anything but, sorry. The point is, I will understand if some graduate engineer wrote this before the road safety audit. Please tell me how on earth somebody could write this in response to a ratio rise. And the issue is less than, okay, you have narrow cycle length. And last but not least, just to say, This is signed by executive director of transfer for New South Wales. This is not signed by a graduate cadet. Executive director for active transfer and vibrancy. I have no idea what vibrancy means in the context of traffic engineering, but it's on them to explain. Let's go now. We actually find out that they introduced, which is okay, that's fine, you know, just this concept and there is interaction between cyclists and pedestrians. So pedestrians have you know just a false sense of security, we are stepping on the zebra crossing, everyone needs to give way to us. And the cyclists riding you know for a certain length seeing green you know just a green you know just a painting in front of them, a green line in front of them could genuinely be misled to believe, and we have a lapse of concentration or cognitive load, I'm not going to expand in that area, to, and actually the conflict could occur and they could struck pedestrian. But especially the worst thing is that these days you have those electrical bikes, which I called nothing else, you know, just the same thing as a motor scooter. Except you put the petrol, you have electrical bikes. So we actually was considering that and commenting that there is no signage or any information to see who has to give way to whom. Usually I was lead auditor for City of Sydney a long time ago for the Burke Road, Burke Street, all those cycling facilities. And one of the options, you know, is that actually you paint like a triangle, you know, just a triangle like a giveaway sign and small giveaway sign for cyclists to emphasize. It's not that cyclists are bad, but people actually simply overlook sometimes. That's a very, very different topic. And then this is actually a response. I just don't want you to cry or to laugh. The two new rice crossings, including Cross Street, where there is currently a pedestrian refuge, will significantly improve safety for pedestrians by slowing vehicles on approach. Slowing vehicles on approach. We're talking about cyclists and they're responding about vehicles. I get the impression they never read this. Improving accessibility and increasing visibility. What on earth has accessibility and visibility and vehicles with this particular, you know, just issue? We just said, look guys, you know, just you actually have a problem because cyclists may actually struck pedestrian on the zebra crossing. They said, we received community feedback about importance So they now take, you know, just leverage on community. So you guys are responsible. We see community feedback about the importance of safer pedestrian crossings, including from parents who cross the road to take young children to daycare. How that actually has anything to do with this, but that's exactly what we want to prevent. Young children and parents, you know, just to be striked by a cyclist. We are pleased the improvements will be a direct benefit to them and many others. Okay, tell me what I'm missing here. How they could be pleased if actually after we figure out that could be a situation where the cyclist actually could be struck by, sorry, a pedestrian could be struck by a cyclist. These two new rise pedestrian crossings will function in the same way as other pedestrian crossings in New South Wales. I spoke with John about this and what that legal implication has. Okay, please tell me how many crossings you actually saw around here, you know, just who actually have a, okay, rice crossings, many of them, but with the cycling facilities. I mean, a huge number, and there is none with the cycling facilities. So what does it mean? That statement is not true. Bike riders are required to give way to people walking as per New South Wales road rules 2014. I will tell you the principle. I have, you know, just as a part of my collision investigation training, no less than 10 trainings, one unit degree training in the field of human psychology, and nine forensic training from the United States in the human factors. And many times, actually, collisions occur one kilometer, and fatal collisions from the home. And on many occasions, the judge asked me, "Okay, is it that the guy is familiar, that the accused was familiar?" I said, "Your Honor, the sad truth is "that so many people die one kilometer "from their home all around the world. "The problem is that we need to remind people "about the hazard." So if you remind people about the hazard, and every hazard must be reminded about, then people, you know, just are more alert, and perception reaction time is shorter, and chance to avoid collision or avoid incident is much higher. So you cannot rely, oh everyone knows that. You don't actually go and read the textbook when you approach the intersection and say you know what, I approached the intersection and I need to turn right and stuff like this. Also what I actually find out, I publish it in the book of the pedestrian crossing behaviour as part of my second master in transportation and it's mazun.com, what I actually said in that book there is no such thing as average pedestrian. There is no such a thing as average cyclist. There is no such a thing as average human being. Everyone reacts differently and we all react differently in different situations during the same day. If you actually go walking here, you walk more relaxed. If you're going to the city, the same you somehow is rushing. There is some anxiety. So in the morning you behave differently in the afternoon. When you are tired, if you're actually driving here in the peak hour and stuff like this, the job is different story, fatigue. Now again, this is absolutely what in every situation ever is just drafting mistake. No big deal. So instead, those signs to be here, they need to be here. So that's the standard. And we just said like this, okay? So those signs need to face drivers before the zebra crossing, not after. And I consider generally, just a drafting mistake, that's happened, no big deal. But this is actually a response. All new signage placement will be consistent with the Australian roads guidelines. When you're auditing the tile design, there is no future tense. When you're actually auditing a preliminary design, there may be future tense. Like we will actually do that in design stage and then you close something on the condition that that will be done in the design stage. But they have a detailed design that should be approved and according to which they should construct just the cycling facility. And they're talking about future tense, when that is going to happen. These improvements will enhance safety for people walking and for all road users, including at pedestrian crossings. How on earth this has anything to do with a drafting mistake that just they position sign on the wrong location. side street will be removed. What redundant side street? Transport has already made changes in conflict areas with side streets intersecting with bridge roads. Please tell me what I'm missing here. How actually, why are they actually talking about side streets? It's a just drafting mistake. There are new warning signs for road users exiting side streets, a new painted green -- put this way -- and green road markings for road users entering. And that was the issue. What actually side streets? conflict with the side streets. I don't understand. And this is written by, again, executive director for, you know, just active transport and vibrancy. Fancy title. Issue number five. Okay. So that's very, very simple stuff, I mean, just to fix and therefore, you know, just it's very useful when you have the tile design or safety audit because many things you could actually fix on the drawings before coming, you know, or just into the real life. They actually propose traffic to merge. The left lane ends. However, they're missing some signage. And we actually show from Australian standards what signage is missing. And that we actually just also said, this is during the night. Okay, don't worry about these bubbles. That's on the GoPro camera that was on the bonnet. But at the same time, so in that regards, your vision is better. But on the other side, you will be, this glare from oncoming traffic would impact your vision, all right? So the problem, I will tell you, the problem with the human eyes is that human eye always adjust, adjust, people always adjust to the bright source. And then everything else is dimmed. And I will tell you a few things about that. So you actually have, you know, just this situation at night, rainy night, oncoming vehicles, glare and everything else, and you don't have a signage, you're not fully aware of a merging location, and then we said side-slide collisions and other collisions could actually occur. What they say, all new signage placement will be consistent with the Haussler Roads Guidelines. They copy-paste everything. We said that it's not consistent, they say it will be consistent. I mean, I just actually believe that people who rode this have no idea, zero, nothing about what is road safety audit all about. These improvements will enhance safety for people walking and for all road users. I'm sorry, you don't need to be expert. You're not expert. But tell me how this actually has anything to do with people walking? And we're talking about collide, two vehicles colliding with each other because they are not aware of the, at least one of those drivers are not aware but about merging locations, including pedestrian crossings. What pedestrian crossings has to do with this? New merge signage will be added to this location. What location, what new merge signage? And future tense doesn't work in the entire design. In the entire design, when you issue the road safety audit, they have to provide their comments accompanied with amended drawings. Not what they will do in the future. The same thing, I don't want to repeat, so the conflict, the same answer, indeed. Now, you remember that Austral Road said, so it's not that I'm inventing something that said, among other things, you need to consider side lines between the road users. Now, when looking westbound from the viewpoint of Yggdrasil driver, on the several, you know, just several mature trees, this is it, from that particular location, several mature trees obstruct the visibility of the road users. So imagine now, I believe this is an electrical bike as well, this delivery guy could zip from there to here very quickly. The problem is when you actually are entering the road, there is something called glancing. You glance in one direction, then glancing in another direction, etc., etc. in order to find a safe gap. And this could actually cause a lot of problems. Now, because why? Because you cannot clearly see the cyclist on the cycling facilities before your front of your vehicle protrude into the cycling facility. That's a serious question. Now, I just would like to read to this. Changes have-- they said sight lines. and visibility. So they are methods, it's not that they are mistaken. Changes have already been made in conflict areas with side streets intersecting the bridge road. In that street we have installed new warning signs for road users exiting side streets and painted new green road markings for road users entering them to advise them of the cycleway. Nobody raised this question. Yes indeed, they painted just the markings, nobody questioned that. Yes, the road users would be aware about the presence of the cycleway, but that's not the point. The point is, you know, just the sight line. You're approaching every single intersection, you're aware of the presence of the intersection. But the point is, the difference, if you could see the approaching vehicle in the time to find a safe gap. So this has nothing to do with the issue. The final design for the bridge road cycleway includes further measures such as signage and payment markings, improvements on the cycleway. Nothing to do, not a single letter with the issue. The cycleway has been officially open since September 2020 and in this time there have been no recorded crashes on transport safe system, whatever, database involving people driving out of this side street and colliding with people riding bikes on the street. Okay, Okay, put it this way. I will tell you from my experience. In 2003, I was working in Marlborough, New Zealand. One morning, my boss actually told me, "Okay, Zoran, go from Blinheim to Havelock and back." Some of you may be familiar with some, no, it doesn't matter. Stay highway one. I was road safety manager for two regions, whatever. And then actually tell me with fresh eyes what is the most critical part of the road. I analyzed everything and I said on the back, "This corner, this corner, this corner." I was laughing stock for the next three days. You know why? Because the collision never happened there. You missed the point, whatever. Next Monday, the car works in different ways. Next Monday, I walk into the office, green face, I say, "Did anyone die? "What's going on? "Hey, what did you say about that?" On that very corner, that morning, the truck, semi-trailer, 90 meters, roll over, you know, just full of food, whatever, you know, just there in New Zealand. Luckily, you know, just because it was roll over on the left-hand side, the truck driver, you know, just survived. The point is, the fact that something didn't happen. Do you need to wait somebody to die and then today to come here? I remember when actually I was lead auditor on the Burke Road, I said to the city of Sydney, Okay, you need to delineate the end of this curve because somebody could fail. Of course, they were actually all knowing, all smart and stuff like this. Seven days later, a cyclist, boom, right there, they intend to sue or sue council, they immediately put the signage in place. And the point is, it's nothing to do but worse than all. This has absolutely nothing to do with the issue. Now, issue number eight, the same thing, just different side. This is what they don't understand. This is basic, sorry, about you have potential conflict. So the potential conflict is that every single time when I going into the main road and bridge road, because of the safety side lines, there is potential for conflict. Sometimes conflict occur, sometimes no conflict. If conflict occurs, you could prevent it with evasive action or no evasive action is required and you avoid that. So you could result in no collision or collision. The problem is there is in mathematics something called the law of big numbers. If you put enough iterations, house always wins. And this is just not if something happens, just when. It could happen immediately after, could happen in five years time, but what's the difference? But the worst thing, they didn't respond to that. They're talking about some different things. I talk about plumbing, they're talking about garden. (clears throat) So this is another one stuff. The proposed, here, this is a rice separator. And then this is a bus stop. Now, not only that the bus need to shift from the separator, usually the vehicle shift by half a meter, because you cannot actually drive. Try yourself, everyone, today. Drive somewhere near separator and you are going to, because you are not comfy, you know, just to drive five millimeters from that. There is no chance. You need to keep at least half a meter, whatever the speed is, even 20 kilometers per hour. But also, pedestrians going here have to step, tripping hazard, the right curb separator, and you're going to the bus. Or if you actually step from the bus, you're going to broke your ankle there. You step on 400 millimeter separator. This is it. This is it. And what is the response? Please read this. The Pyramid Bridge Road bus stop has designated pedestrian crossing for passengers to get on and off the bus across the cycleway. what it has to do with this, which are clearly marked with the crossing lines. Who mentioned crossing lines? Who mentioned the crossing? We are talking about separator. These crossings will be level with the footpath and will not be trip hazard. Who said that the crossing is trip hazard? And we actually, if they don't know, we actually put just here and here. The trip hazard is crossing is, yes, again, you don't here have just any signage, and that's a crossing, and the people are standing behind this tree, could not be seen by a cyclist that easier, especially at night. And then you notice not only that, you have actually for more fun, this rice curb separator and stuff like this. But the fact that this is level with the curb has nothing to do with that. Nothing at all. The design is not considered existing bus stops. And also the proposed rice concrete bicycle lane separator protruding to the bus stop. This is according to design, this is the sign for the bus stop and this is separator protruding into the bus stop. As I said, evidence, analysis of evidence, reasoning, conclusion. So then, you know, as we said, there is no set path analysis. There is no way that the bus could actually go this way, to turn without encroaching. Conclusion, that's the risk. That's how that should be. Now, they say the cycle barrier will not extend into the bus zone. Please. Is this bus zone, does this extend? Yes, it is. And also what we actually said here, very importantly, when the bus stop, and considering that there is opposing traffic and everything else, and some people may overtake the bus, was observed during the site inspection, what those cyclists are going to do, where they are going to go, who put them in this position? I mean, this audit is more beneficial for the cyclists because ultimately here, most of the time, the receiving edge would be cyclists, and it's not just any cyclist. And I will tell you one thing, and I always said, I met in my life, in my career, many cocky cyclists, and many, you know, just arrogant cyclists. But I never met a single one, after being struck by a car, when actually standing in front of me, and I am actually a collision investigator, and his only hope in the civil case that we'll get some compensation for the injury sustained in the collision that he was blamed for. No one. And the people who actually who actually encourage them to be cocky is nowhere to be seen. Nowhere to be seen, why? because they are not experts in that regard. They are not experts for the corporate. So now we actually have here, and this is again, cycle barrier will not extend under the bus zone, which evidently it's not consistent with the evidence. You make a conclusion. Buses will be able to enter/exit the bus zone without touching the cycle barriers. Okay, please tell me how this bus will be able to do that, and there is no evidence for that. That evidence is called Svet path analysis. But this is not the worst. People riding bikes are in shared traffic environment. Oh. And have the option of either waiting behind buses or overtaking them, whichever is the safest at the time. What does it mean? It means, guys, we created this. Who cares what it said? It is on your own. Whatever you do, if you are involved in the collision, it is your wrong option. >> Yes. >> And the clarity, clarity of the cycle of facilities, one of the, you know, just the pillars of the good design. And by the way, I finish a lot, the best design courses in, for that, but I'm not going to talk about this. One of the pillars. Then again, you have here, you know, just separator, cyclist makes you hit whoever else. There is no any sign like people left or whatever else. And especially this is, as I said, this is better view than you will have in real situation because all this glare would impact your vision, period. And then the dim actually elements on the road here would not be visible for you. But what they said again, all new signage placement will be considered, etc. etc. I don't even want to bother you with this. Now, the proposed traffic lanes are between 2.8 and 3 meters. That's according to design. And that's our opinion. Now, you actually also have those concrete separators on each side, and you consider that you need at least half a meter clearance when you drive a car. And then imagine the delivery truck or whatever 2.5 meters wide. You know what? 2.5 meters, 3 meters minus 2.5 meters is 0.5. 0.5 all clearance, left and right. So you have 25 centimeters here and 25 centimeters there in theory. What does it mean? It means if you make a mistake, if you mishandle your vehicle by half a meter, it's direct head-on offset collision. And I don't want to bother you how deadly offset head-on collision is, even at 40 km/h, because it's 40 in one direction and 40 in the other direction. You have actually delivery trucks, you have buses here. And what we mentioned here, and underline, you know, just for, transfer from New South Wales and consider, a fundamental road cross-section design principle is avoiding multiple minimum this ensures adequate clearance between travel modes. So you don't have clearance between two trucks and you don't have a clearance between truck and the cyclist. And clearance requirements ensure all traffic can travel safely and comfortably because all traffic, all road users, and this is on them. As per item 1.3 that's repeated design of the cycleway is consistent with the current standards and guidelines. I'm speechless. And you could read on your own if you like, but this is just actually what they're saying, and nothing to do with this design, not a single word. Now we actually just mentioned here, okay, this is like, you know, more of the comments that they need to ensure the regular maintenance of the facility, otherwise the leaves and everything else could actually create slippery and stuff like this. Okay, they responded, you could not tell them that they are not going to do. City of Sydney Council has advised transfer that it has smaller street sweeper and can access the cycleway. Okay, let's see. That's on you to check later on. But, you know, just how likely is that? It's a different story. Because, why a different story? Not because I agitated against that or council, but because based on the evidence, I saw the evidence that actually current, maintenance of the current facility is so poor that on some conferences, and I said on, I believe that person, the first one, on the AATPN national meeting, I told her, "Okay, how you're going to propose building new when you actually don't maintain the existing one?" And I said, "The Burke Road is actually in absolutely horrible state of maintenance." And then what I find out, two weeks later, they put new, it was a few years ago, new signage and correct something, because they were embarrassed, you know, just in front of a hundred people. I tell the truth. Okay, this is a very important thing, I would like to tell you. And this would be, I will put you something, my juicy stuff from forensic collision investigation as well. The design does not consider upgrading the current street lighting, or at least there is no evidence for that, okay? The current lighting makes the proposed features such as, but not limited to the right cycle grain separators and rice concrete medians are likely to be clearly visible. This is this, okay? This is the current situation. All this stuff, and I drive a zillion times up and down as a driver and stuff like this, it's not clearly visible. But they don't care about it. Jeffrey MÃ¼tter, this is one of the leading states, in the states, experts from Northwest University and he works for himself in the United States, he's top number one. I finished ninth of his trainings. actually in order to see, the funny thing is, what is visibility? In order to see something, you need to recognize something. Strange, right? So chameleon stay in the broad light, in the plain view of the predator and still survive for millions of years because he's not recognized. And in order, in order to recognize something, in order to see something is contrast, anticipation, pattern, lighting, accestricity, time of exposure, size. Due to poor contrast and not proper lighting, if one of these elements is below a certain threshold, it's not specified in quantitative manner what is the threshold, then visibility is zero. Recognition is zero, visibility is zero. We have poor lighting. I will explain to you too. So I will ask you what you see here, just to give you a grasp of what I'm talking about, how serious is that. What you see here and how many? What you see here and how many? Please raise your hand when somebody, tell me. You see, the point is, after 10 seconds, the best guess, oh, it's horses and three, and then five, after 10 seconds. For 10 seconds, you didnÃ­t see five horses. Why? Because the pattern is broken, the contrast is broken, shape is broken, the time of exposure is too short to be recognised. That's the same thing in traffic. And those ten seconds is when you don't react to whatever is in front of you. What you see here, please. This is in front of my office in North Sydney. Could you see something strange here? On this photo? Yeah, here. Be focused here. Do you see something offenderous here on the photo? This is a cyclist here. This is a cyclist here. This is a cyclist here. The point is, and this is much better than you could see, I took these photos a few days ago, this is much better than you could see in the reality because you can't see anything because of this glare. This is what camera capture. And even the camera glare free, you cannot recognize the cyclist. So if you coming now from the side road, being aware that you coming from the side road, and you cannot recognize the cyclist, what is going to happen? You're going to protrude. What's the cyclist going, boom. You don't need master degree to see this. You don't need to be expert. This is what we are talking about. This is what we try to prevent with audit. Another thing, another thing, the same pedestrian on two, this is my wife by the way, and I put here, and she's auditor as well, she's traffic engineer as well. So this is not properly lit pedestrian crossing, and this is properly lit pedestrian crossing. There is no shape, there is no contrast, there is nothing. That's what we say in our report, not because it's fun, but we know what we're talking about, that they didn't provide lighting for the pedestrian crossing. They didn't ensure, they just promised, oh it will be, what lighting? Because proper lighting from traffic safety point of view is not proper lighting, the same thing as proper lighting from electrical point of view. It's not just about luxes or actually strength of the lighting source. It's about visibility of an object of pedestrians at the zebra crossing. So this is what we actually say this actually is how it should be. And they say the two new pedestrian crossings will met Australian standards. What on earth has actually two pedestrian crossings to do? These slides were not part of the report. This part of this presentation. Lighting upgrades will take place at the new rise pedestrian-- we are talking about lighting along this whole road, not just about crossings. And they respond this. This is what, executive director. You know, just active transport and vibrancy. Vibrancy is very important. Sorry, sorry, just a second. So, now I must say something. Several cycling programs. So they actually, Transformation of the New South Wales, introduced in design, pram ramps. I understand that. But we need to consider here and here what we're actually talking about is that people riding bike, genuine people, with actually led, okay, I have pram ramp, that means that I'm led to a food path. But food path is not share path. The food path could be shared by cyclists to certain ages, certain conditions, but not by all cyclists. And even if it's shared by cyclists, the pedestrians and cyclists need to be aware of that, and aware of potential conflict. And this design provide anything but. And as I said, the results is unaware pedestrians failing to notice a potential conflict, et cetera, et cetera. And we put everything there and explain and show the locations. I'm sorry, just what is now, yeah? All right, just here, etc. And this is what Transport for New South Wales responded. "Pram rams are in place for bike riders to safely move from bridge road cycleway to the footpath, which is okay. We never questioned that. But here is not to end, and not continue riding with general traffic." Okay. We never questioned that. That's okay. That's nothing to do with the findings. because what we are talking about is entering, you know, just a space dedicated for pedestrians rather than exiting the space shared by vehicles. And they're talking different story altogether. And then, I don't know how is that. In New South Wales, children under 16 can ride on the footpaths and adults can accompany them. What that has to do? A biker rider with a medical condition and suitable medical certificate and the rider accompanying them are also permitted to ride the footpath. Fantastic. But what actually we don't talk about that. We talk about the conflict that these people may have with pedestrians. And I don't blame riders or pedestrians. We just need to say, okay, we need some specific measures there in place. At each of the PRAM-RAM signage we'll instruct people, instruct people. People riding bikes to dismount to support pedestrians, instruct people to. It is like advisory speed limits, sorry, advisory speed sign. that instruct you that actually that speed is appropriate for a safe and convenient driving through a certain bend. Conclusion, that's what we drive. You may agree or disagree, this is our opinion. It's not about agreeing. Based on the road safety assessment of the design features, the circumstantial evidence obtained during the site inspections and the reasoning behind the subsequent conclusions, Road safety auditors are of the opinion that the proposed permanent cycleway facility, at least at this stage, at this sort of design, along Pyramid Bridge Road would not create a reasonably safe environment for cyclists, pedestrians and motorists. Instead, based on what actually was in the report, what you can hear today, it is likely, in our opinion, it is likely to increase the conflict, number of incidents and ultimately the chance of potential severe collisions between two or more vehicles, vehicles and cyclists and cyclists and pedestrians. And thank you very much. As John Kennedy said, the only reason to give a speech is to change the world. If I could. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Don. This gentleman would like to ask. (indistinct chatter)

Speaker 7
- This gentleman had an accident and he's going to just tell you a little

bit about it. (indistinct chatter)

- Sit

Zoran Bakovic
there. - Broke

Zoran Bakovic
the microphone. - Is that just the microphone? - Yeah, yeah.

Luke
- No, the question is that you're riding on the bike lane.

Speaker 9
- Okay.

Luke
- And you know, rainy day, rainy night,

Speaker 9
I'm

Luke
crossing off and no sign, I'm I hit the car and I didn't stop. I mean, there's nowhere else to go. And basically, the ambulance, when we undercame two hours later, the police didn't even make a report. It's pretty bad when a person's laying here on a broken tree, I went to a party

Luke
and you know what they said to me? "Oh, even though there's a thousand complaints about this issue, but there's no complaints about your thing with the concrete pillar and the rug and so on." And they said, "I'm sorry. See you later."

Zoran Bakovic
If I may, just to answer to this question, first and foremost, I'm very sorry to hear that. And I'm working on such cases a lot. Regarding the legal advice, I don't want to pretend to be Boris as John and other people, but what you're explaining is exactly what is the purpose of road safety audit, to prevent happening and

Speaker 4
occurring.

Zoran Bakovic
And I believe, and tell me if I'm wrong, that people who put that in place, who in charge it in place, never show up to do anything. And then actually, I believe, and it's my genuine opinion and mission, because I work in, I earn, I mean it sounds silly, but it is, awkward, but it is. I earn money in preventing collisions, and if a collision occurs. But as a human being, and because I have children and I could be in collision myself, I dedicate my career to use my knowledge from the collisions to prevent collisions occurring in the first place. Because no one sitting in this room, no judge, no crown prosecutor, no police officer, no minister, not sitting here, is actually immune of these sort of collisions. Or they're children. Because it's not just being killed, you could kill somebody in these facilities. And I know exactly what you're talking about, is that what I mentioned during the presentation.

Speaker 4
- It's that concrete pillow.

Zoran Bakovic
I know, I know, I know. (indistinct)

John Young
- What's your name, sir? - My name, I'm just Luke. - Luke,

Zoran Bakovic
yeah.

John Young
All right, thanks. Thanks very much for sharing that. Luke. - During the, I know we've got some questions, but during the course of the meeting, early during Zoran's address, we had the arrival of two councillors from the City of Sydney, and I recognise those two Councillors. Firstly, Councillor Jess Miller. I'm not sure where Jess is, but I'm, Jess, hi there. Jess has recently arrived, I think, to live in this area. Jess is a member of the Clovermore Independent Team and is recently back on Council, but she has been a long-term Councillor. the other councillor who was slightly late because she had an important engagement watching her son playing football. Did he win? - Grandson, yes he won. - Sorry, grandson, grandson, grandson. - Three times, three times. - Three, oh, fantastic. That's Councillor Yvonne Weldon. Yvonne has been a fantastic voice for the people of Bridge Road and she has been a stalwart champion for us in raising this issue at council. And at times when we had felt that we had no support, Yvonne was always willing to raise it at council. Yvonne was the first

John Young
in the history of Sydney, This

John Young
is astonishing, but 1842, Yvonne was the first Aboriginal councillor elected to the council. But, and I know that Yvonne is a fantastic independent who will fight for the community. What I'd like to do now is to hand it over to you for, I'm sorry, for questions. I know we've got one up the back there, gentlemen right up the second back row.

Speaker 10
- I noticed that in the responses to you, that they mentioned that there had been no accidents on both the sides, but clearly, with the gentleman's experience, and I think it could be a little in the area, have seen that.

Speaker 10
- Yes. - Where are they pulling these statistics

from and why aren't they accounting for it?

Zoran Bakovic
- Okay, I will tell you one thing. You should ask them, because I promise not to advocate and not to be biased or anything else, or not to convince you of anything. You should ask them. Usually, there is a register with Transfer for New South Wales about accidents, and how that works, you know. For example, in New Zealand, when I practiced for five years, we have access, we pay, you know, just to sign some disclaimer, whatever, you could use that on your own. However, here you need to submit a request, which is fine. However, those accidents and record is not up to date. It's maybe several months late and stuff like this. There is a certain process. What is the problem? What is the problem? What is misleading, for example, with those things as well, if I may? And I am discussing about that with some people who are not involved in prosecution and collisions and that sort of thing, analysis. that police, you know, and I'm facing the police evidence all the time for living, the police usually, you're going police officer on the side and you actually lost the speed on the corner, they said speeding. So speeding, for example, what does that mean, speeding? Driving above the speed limit or driving at the speed not appropriate for the road condition. So why am I saying that? because not only that the record is not fully complete, it's always, you know, there is backlog to be put in the system, but also, you know, just actually description that is in the system is based on initial police report and police could not do better. It's not that I don't blame them. That's it. You know, you need to put something. And then the conclusions drawn from misleading information, if you will, why is misleading? But because you know just at least 70% of those statements and reports I turned down in the courtroom so far. So what does it mean? And you cannot just being biased, you need to provide evidence for that, extraordinary evidence. And the judge in court accept that. So based on my experience, they are misleading, but again I don't blame them. So this is it. So it needs some time.

John Young
- Can I just add to that, that hospitals when they're recording information about a cycling accident, it's not a detail that they're particularly concerned about, that the accident happened along Bridge Road. But I always prefer numbers to anecdotal evidence. But if you want a view, a professional view, about whether this is a safe cycleway, go up to the Glebe Police Station. Because to a person, to every officer there, will say this is a dangerous piece of infrastructure. And they are people who, like Zoran, see the consequences of road trauma. And we know what that is. And sadly, we have our friend here who's had that. Yes, up the back as well. Yep. - I just wanted to build

on that. I've twice had someone come over to me while cycling

Speaker 11
and been told by the police that unless I want I didn't work with charges because the unsafe environment is not good.

Zoran Bakovic
But that's what, this is the point that we actually mentioned in our road safety audit as well. If you have a series of minimums, there is no room for mistake. And I don't believe that guy wanted to end up in jail or in court room by striking you or to open, or just to hesitate to open two seconds later. Generally, they don't see you. Because you have children, you have unexperienced people, you have older people driving the car with cognitive abilities difference, with sighting difference, with reflection difference. It's not Formula One drivers. It's not actually, and what actually I rise concern, oh sorry, awareness among the cyclists, if somebody would like to listen. You need to take care about your safety first, then do expecting. And I said to John during one meeting, When I was a kid, as a kid, 50,000 people, a city, we all ride bikes. That was our mobility. And I never heard one kid was struck by a car. Why? Because our mothers and fathers didn't tell us, okay, sweetheart, ride the bike in the middle of the road, and those bad persons, you know, just called motorists would actually take care of you. No, take care, have fun, take care. Ride beside the road. They teach us in the school. And you never had a conflict. And if you don't have conflict, you don't have incidents. That's the point. I will tell you... I think Darlene has

John Young
got a line about that, don't you? About paint and cycleways.

Di Anstey
I think my line about paint and cycleways is green paint doesn't make a safe cycleway.

Zoran Bakovic
Yeah.

John Young
Okay, alright, we've got lots of questions. We'll take one up in front here.

Speaker 7
Yes, please. Surely it's a very little record of accidents because there's a very low frequency of bike riders in that

Speaker 7
cycleway. One of the things that you would notice around this area is that there's practically no one on that cycleway at any time of day.

Speaker 9
So just, could you just switch off something?

Speaker 12
As a cyclist who uses that cycleway.

Speaker 9
I will listen to you, so just in case something is noisy here.

Zoran Bakovic
I apologize, could you just ask? Could you repeat please?

Zoran Bakovic
I apologize because of this, could you please repeat your question?

Speaker 7
I think that the frequency has been exaggerated, because because it is rare to see a cyclist on any of those cycleways.

Speaker 7
Perhaps more where Glebe High School comes up

Speaker 7
at Bridge Road because people have come around the bay, but really it's quite infrequent. Can

Speaker 10
I tell you one more point? There are so many bikes using that cycleway that it's actually

Speaker 12
quite dangerous to cross the cycleway to get to the other side of the road now, or to join the cycleway? Okay,

Zoran Bakovic
may I say one thing? Okay, the fact, okay, if we assume that the number of cyclists is low, okay, let's assume that. There is a good thing about that and a bad thing about that. The good thing about that is the number of incidents of exposure could be low. But the bad thing about that is the expectation of the cyclist to appear on the cycling would be low as well. Which in turn, you cross a zillion times, there is no cyclist. And then zillion the first time, boom, and somebody is actually injured. And that's the difference. And is it, you know, just we need to consider, no, once in the five years, yes, because it's It's not you. Please explain to gentlemen that once in five years you will end up on multiple operations. My job is to tell, and I always say to clients, our job as auditors, because there are two of us as a team, to tell the truth. We are like auditors, like doctors. We actually deliver just actually what is wrong. You go to the doctor, you don't expect the doctor to flatter you and to please you, but to tell you the truth. And by telling the truth, you have a chance to be healed. If doctor said everything's fine for you, sweetheart, because you will be upset if I tell you you are dead in three months. Your call, not your call, the public call. And this is actually what is road safety audit about. To present in unbiased manner, based on the evidence, what somebody in public or road owner need to know. What road owner is going to do about that, it's entirely road owner, not liability for auditors.

Speaker 4
- Issue nine, if you have that bus stop. - Yes.

Speaker 13
- I frequently catch the bus there in the morning with quite a few other

Speaker 13
people. And in the old days, pre-cycle way, the bus would come right up to the footpath and it was sort of easy to get into the bus. You didn't have to

Speaker 13
look up very much. But now we have to walk across the cycle way and there might be half a dozen of us. And a couple of weeks ago, an electric bike rider was coming down and he yelled at us, hurry up, he didn't want to stop. Some of us take longer to get across the fuck away to

Zoran Bakovic
get on the bus. - I know, and that's why we actually said here that some sort of measures are required at least to emphasize and enhance who would need to give way to whom, and at least in that way, whoever is the owner of the facility, if that facility proceeds further with, would be less liable in those situations. And your chance to suffer would be a little lower with that. But if you don't have, and especially you have these days, significant number of those delivery guys riding electrical bikes, who rush, I believe, to earn the buck, and who are tired, fatigue, and everything else, good kids, hardworking kids, but in all these impediments of fatigue and stuff like this, in that particular location. Imagine combine that with night. Imagine you're standing as I show behind the tree because it's bus stop there. Imagine the bus stopping there. You stopping, okay, that's a food pot. Felt sense of security, recipe for disaster. Why? Because there is nothing to alert that poor kid just about you're going to strike somebody. And this is all road safety audit. And you see, hypothetically, say okay we will put this signage and that and this, no everything is fine. I

Speaker 13
didn't.

Zoran Bakovic
Share bikes. No, no, no, no, no, put it this way. This is in the field of traffic planning or planning of those cycle facilities, you know what I mean? For example, road safety audit doesn't consider why you choose, somebody choose this actually as a bike route. We don't consider that. I mean I could discuss, but in different meeting. But road safety audit doesn't consider that, doesn't consider those details. We consider design and you know just the conflict. choose to ride a bike, okay? And is it a shared bike and stuff, is it unfamiliar or not familiar? And road safety, consider as a bottom line, people unfamiliar with environment. So it means if somebody take the bikes, he may be unfamiliar, could be tourist, and is everything in place to alert unfamiliar person about the hazards and the hazardous situation?

Speaker 14
(audience member speaking) I think it's not unduly cynical to say that Transport for NSW is determined to do this cycle. And no force on earth is going to stop them, I don't think. I was really just a question to our local member and the Councillors. I mean, at this point what could we do? Can

John Young
I just take that on notice? What I'm going to do is I'd like to leave a little bit of time at the end if they wish to so that each of Kobe, Yvonne and Jess can respond. That'll be a time to raise that. So if we want to raise what we'll call a sort of policy questions, can we leave that, just park that for a moment? It's an excellent question, but I want to just deal with the technical, any technical questions to Zoran at the moment. Yep. - This

Speaker 15
is a technical question for you. So you're a walkout on the bottom of the risks, Okay,

Zoran Bakovic
simple question. I'm afraid it's not that simple answer but I'll keep it short. We actually just in the planning, this is outside of scope of road safety audit, but I will tell you, in the planning, you know, just the stuff like that, in the planning process for this permanent facility, if you will, and it should be first in those feasibility stage road safety audit. And to see whether or not what you're proposing is feasible. Whether or not you could even provide minimums, which it seems not to be the case based on evidence and let alone just to provide additional buffer zones for people to make mistakes. Because the first principle in designing a road environment is to provide a forgiving road environment. What does it mean? That an environment, if you make a genuine mistake, a genuine correction or whatever, it's not the reason for you to be involved in an incident or collision or to die. I don't think it's that. not there is just room for accommodating, in this particular it's a question for Transport for New South Wales to ask them. I don't want to go into that discussion. I have my opinion but I don't want to go into that discussion.

Speaker 15
Can I just have a follow up question? You said there's no road that's going to be completely safe.

Zoran Bakovic
Is it acceptable

Speaker 15
for roads to have perhaps a high risk in

Zoran Bakovic
certain areas or extreme risk? Okay, I will tell you one thing. If you have an older road, especially in Europe, in urban environments in Europe, you have medieval castle and stuff like this, and then in 19th century or 18th century after the Industrial Revolution, public transport come in place and you have cities like Sydney. Without public transport you cannot go. So the question is, in those streets we could discuss about that. Because that's historical cities, this or that, and you do some different measures. But when you prepare a new design of a new facility, there is no excuse to be high risk or anything like this. You must provide something that is a reasonably safe road environment. What does it mean reasonably safe? Which means if you are reasonable road users, if you drive according to law, more likely than not, in all foreseen circumstances, you will never be involved in collision. That is the minimum. But it is completely unheard of and unacceptable that you create something with a high risk. Who will put that in the report? Yes, please. I've

Speaker 16
been riding a bike in this area since about 2016. And I have experience on bridge roads before the bike lane, while the bike lane, and now with the Schneider. Yes. Did you consider the safety of riding without a bike lane? Because when it was just a through road, people parked their cars on both sides of the road. You had exactly the same congestion, except it was only one lane of movable traffic in either direction.

Speaker 16
Yes. All the different hazards that you've been talking about, about pedestrians crossing, bins being collected, buses and all that kind of stuff. they were all having exactly the same problem money that they were in the main carriageway at that time and as a bike, I mean I just take the lane when I need to and I've got to say with the leaps in that bike lane and with the speed going down the bottom going towards it like, you know, down the hill it really isn't a safe place to be as a bike so you get the road and then you have a lot more space But the thing is, the safety of cyclists, because I thought this was

Speaker 16
basically what I think the whole ethos of this lane is about, is about making a safe place for bikes to ride. Now, is there a different solution that you've looked at, or is there any safety issues that you've looked at? And with that in mind, as opposed to, "Oh, we've got this bike lane, it's not too wide, it's too narrow, there's this and there's that." that is, kind of what the white label is trying to solve, is

Zoran Bakovic
safety for people in the white label. Yeah, if I may, I will tell you how that works. First and foremost, in New South Wales, auditors are forbidden by the transfer of New South Wales and the rules, which is fair enough, to provide solutions for the problems. However, you know, just of course, and there is reason for that, you know, because you're doing snapshot and everything else and analyse, so for any solution there is much bigger study. And therefore I'm not going to answer many of those questions because I'm not here, you know, just ordinary citizen, as a professional, I rely on evidence and I don't have evidence. I know what you're talking about and it's a good point. Therefore, you know, just the difference, what would happen before the cycleway or after the cycleway is a good point. There is pros and cons, but that's not the topic. The topic is that what is proposed would harm cyclists. And we're actually listing the ways that need to be fixed if possible to fix it, not to harm cyclists. So this actually is all about cyclists. It's not about against cyclists, as many people think. Because these days, actually, cyclists believe, okay, if you say something that is not pleased with my ears, you're against me. No. This is the friendliest thing that you could ever hurt. Because it may end up in the same situation as this gentleman. And it could end up tomorrow or the day after, you know, just that stuff. So the point is that without, there are some issues, I agree with you, with that there are some other issues, but those issues, actually the point of this is to be considered in the proper manner, in the proper way, which in my opinion, based on evidence I presented to you and reasoning, are not. And that will harm cyclists first and foremost. And this is just, I don't know if I answered your question, but this is it, because I cannot not now going in political directions because I don't have evidence but you absolutely, there are pros and cons of course.

Di Anstey
As a hypothetical thing in Oxford Street they put a up and down on the same side, is that an alternative, does that take up as much room, is there

Speaker 7
any merit in looking at that?

Zoran Bakovic
Okay I'll tell you one thing, as I said I will stick as auditor, I could be many different things because my profession is doing it, but I stick for this meeting as an auditor. Again you must ask actually transfer from yourself, I will tell you how that works. If you, for example, cheating on tax return, an ATO send auditor to you, and auditor report that something is wrong, it's between you and ATO to resolve the problem, it's not auditor's problem to resolve your problem. I say, okay, auditor cannot fix the problem, that's everything fine, it's not my blame. No, auditor's job is not to fix the problem, auditor's job is to report the problems in genuine, friendly, I mean, in best intention in order to fix the problem. And here, the auditor's actually, this all is about cycling safety. And actually, unless you would like to end up as unfortunately Lou here, a gentleman, that it's all about. And the people who created this design simply didn't read that, as you can see, didn't respond to that, talking the talk. And the funny thing is, I saw two versions of these documents response, identical copy-paste. And also, not just identical, not just those two versions assigned executive director wrote, sorry, Active Transport and Vibrancy. The problem is that's a different name, which means one director was replaced with another and they sound like they created the report. What is the chance that two people create from letter to letter the same thing? And this is the worry. The audit findings is not the problem. This is normal stuff. But the problem is actually inadequacy of the response that ultimately would hurt cyclists not me sitting in my office in North Sydney, trust me, but somebody who will ride here a bike. And that is my mission to tell that what community and Tranport for New South Wales and the Minister will do. I couldn't care less. I did my part. What I could care less to tell you the truth and to stand here.

Speaker 5
( quiet talking )
Conflicts between cars and cyclists (can't hear you)
On the topic about conflicts between cars, cyclists and pedestrians, but you've got no oluition for it (interrupted)

Unknown speaker
But that's not his role

Zoran Bakovic
It's not my job

Speaker 5
But you should have to touch on it, because the underlying problem is speed. You see a  because the underlying problem is speed. You see a lot of pedestrian-- suburban speed limits have been reduced to 30, because it saves injuries. So we're slowing down car traffic, and we're putting speed bumps on bike roads, on bike lanes near pedestrian crossings. And whether stopping cyclists, making them stop behind a stationary bus help mitigate a lot of injuries?

Zoran Bakovic
Okay, I will tell you, I will tell you, Antti. First I said, it's not, I know where you're coming from and it's a good question. As I said, I'm not going to answer fully, but I will tell you just a part of that. When you're talking the speed, what speed do you think you have in mind? I will tell you why. There are design speed, there are speed limit, and there is operational speed. What do you think, which of those two categories actually hurt you if you are struck? Operational speed. And operational speed is 85 percentile of all speed recorded on a certain part. What does it mean? If speed limit is here, 50 or 40, I don't believe that operational speed will be that high. So that's the first thing. The other thing is you cannot put the speed hump on the bus route. It doesn't work that way. So there is a certain, you could actually check that with the transfer from New South Wales and bus associations, etc. On the bike lane? Yes. But first, I mean there is no such a thing as a speed hump on the bike lane. But actually, such a thing doesn't exist because it's out of question. But the point is, it's not the problem, you know, for example, you are a genuine user, rider, right? Do you really believe to strike somebody on the pedestrian crossing? Of course not. You're not a terrorist or suicidal. But what actually could lead you, you work the whole day, you actually cognitive load, you need to deal with riding, you need to take care about the vehicle there, you will grab attention to some sign on the left, etc., etc., and all of a sudden as a fifth, because the government of New South Wales published one actually very good paper on cognitive load. People could juggle on the cognitive load and short-term memory, right? And you would juggle just with up to four tasks at the same time. Now you introduce the fifth one, you need to offload something. That's why actually you're going with your wife and kids and you're driving, no problem, talking. And then you said, "Okay guys, please stop now. I need to turn left here or this intersection. We'll talk later on." Why? Your brain told you that he's at capacity as a cognitive load and you know because you're dealing with cyclists, you need the signal, you need with night glares, you need to observe this and that. And you said, "Okay, please, I am not comfy now in order to, until we turn." You turn left, you continue to talk. That's the problem. If you have sign alerting people, warning people about the conflict point ahead, it's all chance that actually those people would be alerted and if alerted they'd adjust their riding in a way to actually cope with that in a safe and convenient manner. Most likely they're not. It's not guaranteed, but it's most likely they're not.

John Young
All right, now we're going to do a little bit of speed questions and speed answers because I do want to give KB, Yvonne and Jess a chance. Now, somebody up the back there? Was there somebody up the back? Yes, sir.

Speaker 9
I've been a resident and a cyclist and I believe it's a sign of truth. I've stood in Bowling where I could park in front of my place, no problem. Now, as you said, I'm also a cyclist and I've also been in Amsterdam too. I remember years ago, the Lord Mary's was comparing Sydney to Amsterdam. You can't compare Sydney to Amsterdam. They've got wide streets, you do have a different culture over there.

Speaker 9
We've got the narrow streets. The other day, we were crossing, and I just lived... Actually, the photo you took was just in front of my place. We were crossing the pedestrian crossing, and a cyclist came, he nearly slowed down.

Zoran Bakovic
Yeah, but that's what we are doing. I'm doing just what I could in my capacity. No, if you rely, okay, there is so-called free E, education, engineering and enforcement. If you come that you rely on enforcement, that means that engineering and education failed. I mean, enforcement is part of the process, but if you heavily rely on that, police to fix that, that means that everything else failed. And I will tell you one thing. Amsterdam or not, we are here talking, it's not on your address, but just as what I talk about people. Amsterdam or not, first, Sydney is not Amsterdam, That's the first thing. Not Paris, not London, nothing. Secondly, sorry, Burke Road. Bridge Road is not Burke Street. It's not Burke Road. There are similarities to stuff like this. What we are focused here today is just on the bridge, not just road. And the limitations on the bridge road. You know me. Because I will tell you one thing, many times in land and environmental court, when I represent in council against developers, they come, yes, but my actual driveway is just not approved, but look at all other drivers nearby. And all other drivers nearby were approved 70 years ago. So if all other drivers are deficient, they were approved at the time by the current standards and then criteria. And if you're going retroactively, half of Sydney would be actually council, not just on that ground, but you cannot retroactively approve that. And therefore what I'm talking about, what other issues you have in the city and what issues or benefits they have in Amsterdam has nothing to do with the design of this particular facility because what we try to do is to have awareness of the problems that you and everyone like you could actually face as a pedestrian, motorist or cyclist had they proceed with this design at this condition, in this condition. Or they will give up, or they will amend something it's not for me to say.

John Young
All right. Look, I think given the time, you can hear me anyway, surely. I think given the time, we might leave questions there, and I will invite, if they wish to, each of KB. gets the honour as the second tier of government.

Yvonne? Just before that, a question of

Speaker 12
the audience basically. How many people actually regularly cycle along the cycleway on Bridge Road? Could you raise your hands please?

Speaker 7
And not the footpath.

Speaker 12
And not the footpath. Yeah. Put your hands down. Most of us cycle.

John Young
All right, okay. Well, thank you. Now, yeah. So, Kobi. Is there anything that you, and we thank you for all that you've done in terms of representation. I think people don't understand sometimes about what representation involves.

Speaker 4
Can we get a copy of that? We'll be able to help you with copies of documents, sir. You speak to me afterwards and we'll try and give you whatever you want, okay.


Kobi Shetty MP
Thankyou. look I'll keep it brief. I just want to say a big thank you for all you who have continued to raise these issues and these concerns about the safety on this cycleway. I am a big advocate for cycling, I ride a bike, I actually use the cycleway myself, and having lived in other cities that do design cycleways that are safer I can say unequivocally that I don't think the Bridge Road cycleway is safe in its current state.
There's several merge points which have been pointed out in the safety audit where you're thrown back into traffic and it's only that I'm a long-term, very experienced cyclist that I feel comfortable riding along that route. I wouldn't want my kids to ride along it, I wouldn't encourage anyone who's a beginner cyclist to ride along it and so I think there's many, many valid safety concerns that have been raised and we continue to raise.
I think part of the problem that we've got with Transport for New South Wales is they are determined push ahead with it in this location. My predecessor Jamie Parker had suggested that a better route would have been along St. John's Road where it's a quieter street, it was much quieter and it had a lot more scope to fit all of the needs of people who use that stretch. But unfortunately it feels like Transport for New South Wales are just digging their heels in and want to progress no matter what and I think we've got a minister and we had a minister before that who unfortunately don't feel like they want to push back much against the behemoth that is Transport for New South Wales.

So it's my responsibility to continue raising these concerns along with the community and just do what we can to try and get your voices heard. So thanks for continuing to do this work.

John Young
And thank you. - Thank you.

(loud applause)

John Young
Now, next is Jess Miller, because Jess is alphabetically first and is a longer serving councillor. (laughter) So you get second go, Jess.

Jess Miller
(audience member speaking faintly) - Hey everybody. Firstly, I think thanks to all of you in the Glebe Society for taking the initiative to actually do this work. Nobody asked you to, and I think it's really important when the community actually play an active role in identifying issues that only people who live in the area would fully understand. So firstly, thank you for doing that.

Kind of echoing what Kobi said, it does feel like the cycleway is an inevitability, but I don't think that's a reason to give up. I think that we're at the point now where with this level of detail, the city's in a pretty good position to be able to identify specific design changes that could improve it. It's probably not gonna be major surgery, it's more akin to, I guess, acupuncture and identifying those points that Kobi sort of mentioned where you're brought into the main street and also one of the major concerns that we've been raising with the minister directly has been where Pyrmont Bridge Road comes into the fish markets and where you've got the confluence of people coming quickly down a hill with pedestrians like bleary-eyed tourists jumping off a bus. Like it just doesn't make a lot of sense and we know that there are other options that ought to be explored.
So I know that Clover's got a meeting with the Minister next week. There's a laundry list of items that are on that list, including that specific part of the fish markets. But what we can do is take the work that you guys have done, add it to it, and just be very pointed about what the specific things we're asking for are and try and do that in the spirit of collaboration. I have the same concern that if we pick a big fight with Transport, you know, recent history would suggest that they are likely to dip their heels in and they are likely to become that immovable object whereas potentially working with Minister Graham, who seems like a pretty sensible kind of minister. 

Audience member
He's not here today, he's not here 

Speaker 4
Well, yeah, no, (garbled). I'm being polite. I'm choosing to be optimistic, so hopefully we can work with him and his office to make him aware of community knowledge that he might not be getting from the bureaucrats. And I think that's usually when you've got these enormous organizations, you'll get a couple of very powerful personalities what it is and not really take into account the lived experience and the knowledge of people who actually live in the community, use the infrastructure. And you know, lo and behold, might have a better idea. So I think I can take this back to Clover and try and get that pretty specifically on the agenda meeting for next week.

Speaker 4
Has Council got that report?

Jess Miller
I believe so, yeah, I think it has been circulated. So that will go into the staff who do that. I'm not an expert in any of this, but we can also, I can raise it in the pedestrian, in the cycling committee that I'm a part of. So that deals with the more technical stuff. But just to manage expectations, it's not a council project, it's a transport project. So we can advocate and we can suggest we can put up alternates, but we can't fundamentally change the course of direction.

(unintelligible)

John Young
Can I just say, Jess, just before Yvonne comes up, that some of us may be getting on a bit, but the fight ain't over. (LAUGHTER) As Teddy Kennedy once said, "The will endures and the hope lives on, and the dream shall never die." (LAUGHTER)
Now, I'd like to invite Yvonne Weldon to speak. (APPLAUSE)

Yvonne Weldon
Thank you, Vic and Ken. I actually was sitting there listening to what was being presented and thinking about some of the issues I've raised at Council, and particularly I would like to, if I can, for those that haven't participated or come along, 'cause it is a little bit painful sitting through Council meetings at times, I can attest to that. But for me, I actually want to share with you the words that I shared in June 2024, particularly the last notice of motion I put up, to Council, which was voted down by Clover and team. The misrepresentation of facts relating to safety issues on Bridge Road in Glebe and failed to warn cyclists how dangerous a temporary cycleway continues to put cyclists' lives at risk. It is the opposite of evidence-based policy making to design and construct a cycleway knowing there are unresolved safety issues. In 2017, design for cycle lanes on Bridge Road was presented by Council to Transport for New South Wales. The proposal was rejected due to the findings of a road safety audit commissioned by Council which cited numerous safety concerns, including Bridge Road was too busy for cyclists to safely ride. In 2020, Council encouraged Transport to install a temporary cycleway on Bridge Road as part of the government's response to COVID-19. Even before it was officially opened in September 2020, it was obvious the design was dangerous. To their credit, concerned residents, as you all know, crowdfunded the independent road safety audit which found more than 24 serious risks of injury to cyclists on the cycleway. The current conditions, I said this was last year, and we know it has been improved, the current condition of Bridge Road Cycleway is disgraceful. The cycleway has made the historical Bridge Road as ugly as Oxford Street has become along the way. The idea that temporary flaps that fall into traffic and can fix barriers no longer bolted to the road offer any protection to cyclists is a dangerous lie. For community updates confirming a new permanent cycleway will be built have been uploaded on Transport NSW website since March 2022. Most recent one last month, and this was again last year, did not specify a date when construction would commence and the design for the permanent cycleway was buried in an attachment to the announcement. However, the devil is in the detail of the documents released to the Glebe Society under GIPA. The fact that this information had to be sought under GIPA is an indictment to each and every one of you. It is required that a design safety audit has been conducted on the design for the permit cycleways. However, the audit did not include some of the crucial safety evidence. Of critical importance is the treatment of the proposed for the right hand turn lanes from Bridge Road where it narrows at Glebe Point Road and Ross Street, were not included in the Road Safety Audit. This issue has been contentious with much of the correspondence between Council and Transport on the issues for at least four years. At least four years. And here we are in 2025.
It is open to conclude that the issue was not addressed in the Road Safety Audit because some officials know either that A, there is no satisfactory way of dealing with this safety concern, or B, that the auditor would criticise the proposed treatment. If a cyclist or pedestrian is killed as a result of installing a cycleway where dangers are known and excluded from the independent design safety audit, it would lead to a case of criminal manslaughter for those involved in the decision making. It is exactly the same as building with safety problems concealed from building inspectors or inspectors being induced to ignore safety issues.
It is essential Council demand Transport from New South Wales commission new day and night independent design stage road safety audits for the design of the permanent cycleway on Bridge Road B, which will take into account all issues impacting safety. Council, all of Council, has a duty to speak up for the residents of Bridge Road who have lost access to their properties and endured four years of hell since the cycleway was installed with a promise by the Lord Mayor and Minister for transport that they would be in place for only six months. Not long after the cycleway was installed, most cyclists made up their own minds that the cycleway on Bridge Road was not safe to use and instead ride on the quieter St. Johns Road or on the footpath, creating danger for pedestrians. It is time for Council to be honest and face the truth, that Bridge Road is not the right road for a cycleway. It was the conclusion from the former Transport Minister, Andrew Constance and Rob Stokes, who's now the Chairperson of Planning, I think, in Council, mind you, who told residents that the cycleway was unsafe and a mess. And as Kobi had said at a community forum before, and reiterated here today, that she wouldn't let her children ride on Bridge Road.
I bring this to you today because at that meeting that I said those words, I was voted out of order. (audience laughing) I was voted out of order Because how dare I raise any of these crucial issues? This is what we're dealing with, people. There are people that say things, and there are people that do things. And there are people that say things behind closed door, and agree to things that impact each and every one of us. The fact that a GIPA had to be undertaken to get the facts, get the facts, it's only then we start to see some real change.
My greatest concern is that people continue to make those deals or those conversations or agreements behind closed doors. But it's actually in every one of our lives that have been impacted. I did actually, I think John, from memory, raise three or four different times about it changing to been taken off Ridge Road and look at the other roads that will be safe. But yet I was tutt-tutted or voted down because I'm irrelevant, 'cause I'm only one true independent councillor on the city of Sydney.
I thank you for all of the issues that you continue to raise, and I will continue to raise them, because every one of you are impacted in a way. Some people support riding on the road. I actually have fear walking on the footpath on the road. So if we think that is safe for anyone, if it's not safe for me, it's certainly not safe for my grandchildren or your grandchildren, or even my mum, or if I still have grandmothers, obviously, what would be safe for them? It is not safe for any one of us. And it shouldn't be expected that it's going to become safe just because you do an audit, or because you actually make an agreement for somewhere else down the road. I think we need to be very clear about the big development that is happening down in the fish markets. There are agreements being made because of that. And people will make other agreements around cycleways and active transports and all those other things, buzzwords that they like to say. But it's people that live here, because let's not forget, the people that this is being planned for is not for the very people that have lived here. Some of us, some people, for their entire life. It's all of those other people that come from other areas. They are having an impact here. But those people's impact are going to be on your lives, but also on theirs, because they think it's safe for them, 'cause they don't live here. It isn't safe for any cyclist. There are some that will ride it because they are experienced or they are prepared or they think that it's safe enough to do so. The reality is, do we have to wait for someone to die to take action? And the action that you're doing here today and that I will continue to do on behalf of you if you need me to, because it cannot be about people saying that they're going to write or they're going to talk to the Minister. It's people that actually need to be spoken to from the Minister in our communities. And better still that he ride on Bridge Road first. Thank you.

[Applause]

John Young
Thank you, thank you Yvonne, thank you for what you said today and thank you for all that you've done over the last few years in relation to this issue. Now I'd just like to invite Di to speak and perhaps we could have a little bit of an exchange if people have got views about that, but the way ahead because we, inspired by Yvonne's words, we do not believe this fight is over. And we-- 

- Hell no. (audience laughing)

John Young
- So I just want Di, who, as I mentioned at the outset, has been our inspiration and the driving force over the last few years to speak about that.

Di Anstey
You mean just because I'm a cranky old man? (laughing)
No, I just wanted to say something. This cycleway has been described for the last five years as being part of a connected cycling network. It doesn't connect to anything, it never will. So that's something we have to bear in mind. The way forward is we will continue to push for the Minister to meet with us until he hears what we have to say, not what his advisors are telling him.

[Applause] 

Di Anstey
We will be launching a website in the next little while where we will have information and documents uploaded for anybody who wants to access them, and I'm sure that there will be regular updates coming from the Glebe Society and I would like to thank the Glebe Society for their support in everything we've done so far.
Now just as a little bye, after we've heard everything today, how about a show of hands, and this is just something that's popped into my mind, show of hands for who would like the cycleway to be removed.

John Young
I'm allowed to vote.

(laughter)

Di Anstey
Now also,

Who would like you to be retained?

Unknown
Yes, if you like, yes. Okay, sure.

Di Anstey
Now just talking about the option of St John's Road, that was raised - 
Thank you very much, Kobi, for your time.

Di Anstey
Thank you.
St John's Road was raised as an option. Howard Collins and one of the safety auditors from Transport for New South Wales actually walked St. John's Road and said this is the preferred road. They were voted down by Transport New South Wales bureaucrats who said Bridge Road is a direct route to the city. No it's not. And then, unfortunately, Council went ahead and installed beautiful gardens on all the side streets, on the corners, which precludes a cycleway ever being built. And we know that our late great friend Ian Stephenson had raised that with Council and said to them, "Don't you think you should wait "until the bridge road thing is settled "before we install these gardens?" And the answer was, "No, we've got the money to spend now." So thank you everybody. for your time today. Really appreciate it. Thank you.

I know people have got to run, but I do want to thank Zoran Bakovic for that.

And I also want to thank Di, I want to thank the Glebe Society, I want to especially thank Daniel and Chloe Anstey, and I want to thank (inaudible) for everything that she's done and Councillor Yvonne Weldon and Councillor Jess Miller, and to all of you for being here.

Thank you very, very much.
